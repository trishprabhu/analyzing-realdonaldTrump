# analyzing-realdonaldTrump

Overview: This project aims to explore US President Donald Trump's Tweets in the months leading up to the 2020 General Election. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has used social media  extensively, through which he reaches over 88 million followers on Twitter alone. Given the influence his Tweets have had during his Presidency, I wanted to better understand what was driving his behavior (and specifically, his sentiment) on Twitter, and how those patterns compared to those of his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.
